# Gabriela Angel's portifolio

## Website Description

The goal for this website is to work as a portifolio. With this purpose in mind, I included one page to showcase my bestworks, a hompage and an information page containing the ‘About’ section and ‘Contact’ section. The number of pages were minimal so the user has access to the most important information without wasting any time.

## Challenges

- Adding a purple overlay to the images

    As it can be seen in the mock up, my initial idea was to add a purple overlay to some of the website's pictuers and reveal their true colors when hovering in the desktop website. However, since there's no 'overlay' rule in css, I did not know what to do.
    At first, I tried using the 'filter' rule, but I was only able to make my images go from black and white to their original colors. Even after doing some research, I could not find a way to add the purple overlay using only css. For that reason, I decided to edit the images on Photoshop, including the purple overlay. Then, I added these images to the html file together with the original ones, and used Sirv's css code to swap the images on hover.


- Carousel gallery

    To display my works, I wanted to create a horizontally scrollable gallery, and more specifically, one that you could just click and drag to scroll, instead of having to click on arrows. Since I have little to no knowledge of JavaScript yet, I did not know how to achieve this feature.
    After doing some research, I found the Flickity website. Flickity offers a group of css and JavaScript files that allows you to build a carousel gallery that checked all the boxes for what I wanted my work display to look like.
